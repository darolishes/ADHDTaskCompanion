# Refactoring Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The ADHD Companion is a monorepo project consisting of multiple applications and shared packages:

- Backend (Node.js/Express)
- Documentation (Next.js)
- Native App (React Native)
- Shared UI Components
- Configuration Packages

## 2. Goals and Objectives

1. Improve code maintainability and readability
2. Enhance performance
3. Strengthen type safety
4. Reduce code duplication
5. Improve testing coverage
6. Streamline state management
7. Optimize build processes

## 3. Key Areas for Refactoring

### 3.1 Component Architecture

- Split large components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Move shared UI components to the ui package
- Implement proper component composition
- Standardize prop interfaces

### 3.2 State Management

- Review and optimize React Query usage
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Centralize global state management
- Add proper error boundaries

### 3.3 Type System

- Strengthen TypeScript configurations
- Add comprehensive type definitions
- Implement strict type checking
- Share types across packages

### 3.4 Performance Optimization

- Implement code splitting
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Add proper lazy loading
- Improve rendering performance

### 3.5 Testing Infrastructure

- Set up comprehensive testing framework
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests
- Add end-to-end testing

## 4. Timeline and Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Analysis (2 weeks)

- Review current codebase
- Set up testing infrastructure
- Establish coding standards
- Create detailed task breakdown

### Phase 2: Core Refactoring (4 weeks)

- Implement component architecture changes
- Optimize state management
- Strengthen type system
- Add basic test coverage

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization (2 weeks)

- Implement code splitting
- Optimize bundle sizes
- Improve load times
- Profile and optimize performance

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (2 weeks)

- Complete test coverage
- Update documentation
- Perform final review
- Deploy and monitor

## 5. Success Metrics

- 90% test coverage
- 50% reduction in bundle size
- 30% improvement in load times
- Zero TypeScript any types
- Improved Lighthouse scores
- Reduced build times

## 6. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Risks

1. Breaking changes affecting multiple packages
2. Performance regression during refactoring
3. Extended development timeline
4. Integration issues between packages

### Mitigation Strategies

1. Comprehensive testing before deployment
2. Regular performance monitoring
3. Phased implementation approach
4. Frequent integration testing
5. Regular stakeholder updates

## 7. Resource Allocation

- 2 Frontend Developers
- 1 Backend Developer
- 1 QA Engineer
- 1 Technical Lead

## 8. Review and Approval Process

1. Code review requirements
2. Testing requirements
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Documentation standards
5. Deployment checklist

## 9. Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regular performance monitoring
- User feedback collection
- Bug tracking and resolution
- Documentation updates
- Regular dependency updates

## 10. Conclusion

This refactoring plan aims to improve the overall quality, maintainability, and performance of the ADHD Companion application while minimizing risks and ensuring smooth delivery of updates to end users.
